    "Vectors, as we will use them, are ordered arrays of numbers. In notation, vectors are denoted with lower case bold letters such as $\\mathbf{x}$.  The elements of a vector are all the same type. A vector does not, for example, contain both characters and numbers. The number of elements in the array is often referred to as the *dimension* though mathematicians may prefer *rank*. The vector shown has a dimension of $n$. The elements of a vector can be referenced with an index. In math settings, indexes typically run from 1 to n. In computer science and these labs, indexing will typically run from 0 to n-1.  In notation, elements of a vector, when referenced individually will indicate the index in a subscript, for example, the $0^{th}$ element, of the vector $\\mathbf{x}$ is $x_0$. Note, the x is not bold in this case.  "

    "# 4 Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstract\n",
    "Matrices, are two dimensional arrays. The elements of a matrix are all of the same type. In notation, matrices are denoted with capital, bold letter such as $\\mathbf{X}$. `m` is often the number of rows and `n` the number of columns. The elements of a matrix can be referenced with a two dimensional index. In math settings, numbers in the index typically run from 1 to n. In computer science and these labs, indexing will run from 0 to n-1.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## NumPy Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy's basic data structure is an indexable, n-dimensional *array* containing elements of the same type (`dtype`). These were described earlier. Matrices have a two-dimensional (2-D) index [m,n].\n",
    "\n",
    "2-D matrices are used to hold training data. Training data is $m$ examples by $n$ features creating an (m,n) array. We will not often do operations directly on matrices but typically extract an example as a vector and operate on that. Below you will review: \n",

    "## Matrix Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "The same functions that created 1-D vectors will create 2-D or n-D arrays. Below, the shape tuple is provided to achieve a 2-D result. Notice how NumPy uses brackets to denote each dimension. Notice further than NumPy, when printing, will print one row per line. Here are some examples"
